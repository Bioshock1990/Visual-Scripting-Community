# Visual Scripting.Community
#### Bolt.Addons.Community for Unity Visual Scripting 2021+
**Author:** [**Bolt.Addons.Community**](https://github.com/RealityStop/Bolt.Addons.Community)

I was able to restore what I could, considering that I have zero programming experience and I'm not a professional. Some graphs were successfully restored without errors, but unfortunately, I couldn't save icons for the nodes.
**Tested on Unity 2022.3.1f1.**

**Here's what I managed to fix:**
- EveryXSeconds
- CreateMultiArray
- GetArrayItem
- GetRandomElementUnit
- QueryOperation
- QueryUnit
- SetArrayItem
- RandomNumbers
- CommentUnit
- SomeValue
- StuffHappens
- Todo
- LogicParams
- Gate
- MathParamNode
- FlowReroute
- LongString
- ValueReroute
- OnVariableChanged
